# Setting up Your Environment

During the private beta, please follow the steps below to acquire access and credentials, and to set up your local environment to build your first Adobe Custom Applications.

## Acquire Access and Credentials

- An Adobe Experience Cloud Organization
    - An Adobe Experience Cloud Org is required if you would like to use APIs from Adobe, access Developer Console, set up an Adobe Custom Applications project, publish custom applications, and/or access published custom applications. 
    - As an enterprise customer or partner, you should have access to an Adobe Experience Cloud Org. If you do not have access to an organization:
        - Customers: Please contact your account manager for access. 
        - Partners: Please contact your partner manager or request sandbox access via [Adobe Solution Partner Portal](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/home.html).
- An Adobe I/O Runtime Namespace
    - Adobe I/O Runtime is the serverless environment to which your code will be deployed. The credential is also used to get access to out-of-the-box File & State Store and CDN. 
    - If you do not already have one, please [request trial access](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-runtime/blob/master/overview/request_a_trial.md).  
- A GitHub Account
    - A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account is required for access to React Spectrum.
