# Migrating from Runtime to Firefly

## Adobe I/O Runtime and Project Firefly

Project Firefly builds on top of existing Adobe technologies and Adobe I/O Runtime is one of them. Developers looking to use Adobe I/O Runtime will be getting extra productivity and developer convenience when using Firefly. For example, creating Single Page Applications that run on top of Adobe I/O Runtime is simple when using Firefly. 

## Move your App from Runtime to Firefly

In order to move your application from Adobe I/O Runtime to a Project Firefly Application, you would first need to join the Developer Preview program. You can follow the steps at [How to Get Access to Project Firefly](../overview/getting_access.md).

Once you are added to the Developer Preview Program, you can set up your local environment following [Setting up Your Environment](setup.md).

Follow the following sections on [Creating your First Firefly App](first_app.md)
- Creating a new Project on Developer Console
- Log in Developer Console from your CLI
- Bootstrapping new App using the Adobe I/O CLI

Now you have an empty Firefly App set up. You can now move your Runtime actions into this project and use the Adobe I/O CLI to build, to test, and to deploy your application.
