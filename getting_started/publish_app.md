## 1: Project approvals (Console Part)

Once you have completed development on your project, your application is ready for approval. 

There are three different approval processes within Adobe Developer Console, depending on the type of application that you have built:

1. **Project Firefly applications:** Projects built using the Project Firefly template are built by an organization for use within that organization. Therefore, Firefly applications require approvals by the enterprise organization administrator only. 
    
    Please follow the approval process for [Project Firefly applications](#project-firefly-applications) outlined in this document.

2. **Applications for publication:** Building an application for distribution to general users on the Adobe Exchange requires approval from the Adobe Review team before it can be published.

    Please refer to the [applications for publication](#applications-for-publication) approval process outlined in this document.

3. **XD Plugin distribution:** Currently only available as personal projects, XD plugins must be submitted for review and approval before they can be published to the Adobe XD Plugin Marketplace. 

    For detailed instructions on how to submit an XD plugin for approval, follow the steps provided in the [XD plugin distribution guide](plugin-distribution.md).

### Project Firefly applications approval process

Once you have completed development on a Project Firefly application, it is time to submit the application to your administrators for review and approval.

To begin the approval process, navigate to the *Production* workspace and select **Submit for approval** in the top-right corner of the screen or select **Approval** in the left navigation.
