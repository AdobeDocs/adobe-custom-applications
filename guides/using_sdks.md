# Using Client SDKs for Accessing Adobe APIs

To simplify your interaction with Adobe APIs, we have created a number of libraries for Adobe Experience Cloud solution APIs. These libraries are npm modules that provides a JavaScript abstraction on top of our product APIs. 

You can try it out directly at 
- [Adobe Analytics 2.0 Library](https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-analytics)
- [Adobe Campaign Standard Library](https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-campaign-standard)
- [Adobe Target Library](https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-target)

You can also get started through the CLI by ```aio app init```, and selecting one of the templates to generate project scaffolding automatically. 

While the current implementation focuses on API wrapping, we are looking to add business abstraction layers in the future.
