# How to Get Access to Project Firefly

You can apply for access on [Adobe’s Prelease forum] (http://www.adobeprerelease.com) -> Project Firefly -> Apply. The following information is needed:
* Your Adobe Organization ID. We are granting access to organizations, not to individuals. You can retrieve your Organization ID from [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com), it is part of the URL (something like some_hash@AdobeOrg)
* Describe your use case. For example: “I want to extend/integrate Adobe Experience Platform” or “Adobe Campaign Standard”
* Once your organization has been onboarded, anyone who has a Developer Role or System Administrator permissions will be able to create projects for Firefly in the [Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io)
